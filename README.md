**Update**

As I restyle the page with mobile use in mind I find myself repeating some mistakes. Yes, CSS is frustatin, but yes, I will get it done.

- Style more with conditional logic for session dependent aspects.

1. Get flex nav menu to work using dropwdown or some animation.
2. Add main body, video and library and upload;
3. Finsih login and session info

- Clear the library on Logout
- onLogin fill the library
- add session dependent actions with ternary and what not
- add session dependent for nav and library

- make sure the select animation works
